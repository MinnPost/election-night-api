    <h1>Election Night API</h1>

    <p class="small">A project of <a href="http://minnpost.com" target="_blank">MinnPost</a></p>

    <p>If you work at a small organization without access to AP or Reuters election
    data feeds, or are looking for more local results than these organizations
    provide, the Election Night API is here to help.</p>

    <p>The purpose of this software is to make election results published by a state's
    Secretary of State or Board of Elections on election night available for use on
    websites or in other applications via an API.</p>

    <p>This software will work best in states that publish election results live on
    election night in somewhat machine-friendly formats, like JSON, text files or
    maybe even Microsoft Excel.</p>

    <p>Detailed setup instructions can be found in the
    <a href="https://github.com/MinnPost/election-night-api#election-night-api">README</a>,
    but the general process for setting this up is this:</p>

    <h2>Install the code and dependencies</h2>

    <p>Election Night API is built in Python with architecture based on ScraperWiki. It
    can be run in three ways:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Locally, for development purposes</li>
      <li>On a dedicated server, for election night</li>
      <li>On ScraperWiki, for after the election when results will not be updated frequently</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Write the scraper</h2>

    <p>Election Night API contains a basic template for scraping election night results
    files, but because each state and election is pretty different, custom scripts
    for parsing the results files must be written. You'll need to be able to write
    some basic Python to build a scraper for your state. There's some basic
    guidance in the <a href="https://github.com/MinnPost/election-night-api#adding-or-managing-a-state">README</a>
    and in the <a href="https://github.com/MinnPost/election-night-api/blob/master/states/example/example.py">example code</a>.</p>

    <h2>Deploy the API</h2>

    <p>The API is intended to be deployed on a resourceful server, such as an Ubuntu
    server on EC2, on election night, to be able to handle high demand for the
     results. <a href="https://github.com/MinnPost/election-night-api#deploy">Detailed instructions</a>
     can be found in the README.</p>

    <h2>Display results</h2>

    <p>Although the main purpose of this software is to provide API access to
      election results, the usual reason for doing this is to then display those
      results on a web page. For an example of one way to do that, see the
      <a href="demo">demo</a>.

    <h2>Move to ScraperWiki</h2>

    <p>When election night is over and demand is lessened results are no longer being
    updated frequently, it is easy to move the API off of your server and on to
    ScraperWiki, which has a <a href="https://wordpress.scraperwiki.com/solutions/data-journalism/">free tier for journalists.</a></p>
